As part of my internship at CognoRise Infotech, I have successfully completed and added 3 Java projects to my GitHub repository. These projects were developed to showcase my skills and knowledge in Java programming during my internship period.

Guess the Number: This interactive game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. This program keeps track of user's attempts. This project showcases my understanding of control flow, random number generation, and user input handling.

Digital Library Management System: Developed to streamline library operations, this project enables users to add books, remove books, and track book availability. The system highlights my knowledge of data structures, file handling, and efficient information retrieval.

Calculator App: It performs arithmetic operation such as addition,subtraction,multiplication or division based on the specified operator.

These projects were completed during my internship at CognoRise Infotech, demonstrating my practical application of Java programming concepts and showcasing my ability to develop functional and user-friendly applications. They are available on my GitHub repository
as examples of my internship achievements and to provide insights for other developers and aspiring interns..
